# Gearplanner/Browser:
This is a great tool for getting an idea of what items are available and to plan your gearing. Make sure to switch it to restoration druid and to change the statweights to fit your spec if you want to make use of the score feature.   
For example, I would value crit near or at 0 when playing a rejuv-tree spec.

# Specs and their BIS lists:

A few notes:

- These are very much suggestions and examples. What works for you, in your raiding environment may be slightly different.

- Tier 3 2set is a very strong setbonus, no matter what spec you choose to play. Once you have it, you should use empty globals to put rejuvs on your rogues/ferals. The rank doesn't seem to matter so it can be r1 if you don't think they'll take damage. Can also maintain on self for mana ticks.

- Both Gensis and Gift of Nature now scale with Healing Power as of 1.18.

### Tree/Moonglow: 
If you are the only resto druid in the raid, this is usually your go to. The tree aura provides a strong buff to your healing group.   
You'll want to mostly spam Rejuvenation, max rank is sustainable at relatively low gear levels. Mix in the occasional Regrowth when there are no good targets for a rejuv. Like in a fight where only the tank(s) take damage and already have rejuvs on them.

**Talent Choices:**   
We really don't miss out on much in the resto tree by taking moonglow but we do make a few choices.    
If you find yourself casting a decent amount of regrowths you may prefer Nature's Focus over Subtetlety. Tranquility has a 30 minute cd so you might find it more useful to reduce the cost of Regrowth with Tranquil Spirit or slightly buff Regrowth HoTs with Preservation.

**Gearing Notes:**  
For Naxx, if you don't have access to Crystal Adorned Crown, replace it with T3 Hat and Wear C'Thun belt.   
For Kara40: 5 set 3.5 is very strong, if you do not care to play around it you can break set with Forgotten Hide Pauldrons for better stats.   
T2 8/8 is a strong setbonus that accels in raid wide damage fights, worth keeping for a while.

## Nature's Grace/Regrowth:  
If another resto druid is playing tree you usually want to play this spec. It is quite mana hungry so with early gear you may be forced to skip Nature's Grace in favour of Tree of Life but this will reduce your throughput significantly.  
You'll want to mostly spam downranked Regrowths. Rank 6 or 7 can be a good choice but try and see what works for you. Max rank is useful occasionally but quite expensive. While you are moving you should look to put up Rejuvenations. If possible, heal raid members that don't already have a regrowth hot on them but this isn't always an option.

**Talent Choices:**   
There really isn't much choice here in 1.18. As mentioned above you can take ToL over Nature's Grace if your gear isn't great, but this will reduce your throughput significantly. Some players like to take Healing Touch talents and cast both spells but you give up a lot by taking those talent points elsewhere in 1.18.   

## Nature's Grace/Healing Touch:   
This build is pretty mana efficient but rarely played anymore. Healing Touch having a long cast time doesn't fit the current healing meta very well and it's throughput isn't amazing. You'll mostly spam downranked HT. Rank 4 is popular due to it having a low cast time but still scaling well with HP. Many players will use 4 or more different ranks depending on the amount of healing needed.    
Aessinas Bloom sinergizes decently well with having other restos use their hots. I haven't played this myself in quite a while so I can't give too much advice.    
Talents are fairly locked in with 1.18.

## 0/0/51:   
This build doesn't excel at anthing like the others do, it's just kinda okay at everything. Rejuv spam loses the least value by ignoring the balance tree like this build does. I do not recommend this, but some value it's flexibility.
